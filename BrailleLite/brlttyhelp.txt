Insist on chord for *dangerous* commands, i.e. routing, cut/paste etc.

INTERNAL:

g chord: position internal (alternate inversion?) cursor for routing or
  cutting.  Terminate with route, cutbeg, cutend or cancel.  To move
  cursor: chrlt, chrrt by 1; bar by (width+3)/4; lnbeg, home, lnend for
  beginning, middle and end of display.

k chord toggles keyboard emulation mode - initially off.
When on, unchorded characters passed directly to inskey(), unless prefixed
by:

u chord: uppercase (twice to lock)
q chord: unlock
x chord: control character
35 chord: meta or ALT (hardwire to `^[' for the time being)
z chord: cancel preceding meta/control

In addition:
b chord: backspace
d chord: delete
t chord: tab
46 chord: return

Other internals:

2356 chord: rotate BrailleLite by 180 degrees
o chord: set two digit (00-99) repeat count for following command.  Starts
  at 00 (default 01), new digits scroll in from right.  Either terminate
  with e chord, or z chord to cancel, or chorded command.  Works with
  cursor movement as well as keyboard emulation.
