<P>Comments and criticisms are welcome.  We will try to respond promptly
to all (sensible) mail, but give no guarantee.  In general, we suggest
you send email messages to all three active developers, rather than
just one; if you don't hear anything, please be patient---make sure
you copied the relevant addresses accurately, though.</P>
<P>If you have a query about a particular display type supported by
BRLTTY, you may want to contact the author of that particular driver.
See the <CODE>README</CODE> file in the relevant subdirectory for contact
details.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Future Enhancements</A></H2>

<P>Apart from fixing bugs and supporting more types of Braille
display, we hope, time permitting, to work on some or all of the
following:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Better attribute handling</B><DD><P>Attribute tracking, mixed text and
attribute mode etc.</P>
<DT><B>Revision of cut &amp; paste</B><DD><P>Linear (as opposed to rectangular)
cut mode.</P>
<DT><B>Revision of beeps</B><DD><P>A greater variety of beeps.</P>
<DT><B>Scroll tracking</B><DD><P>Locking the Braille window on one line as it 
scrolls on the screen.</P>
<DT><B>Elementary speech support</B><DD><P>Mixed Braille and speech for faster
reading of text.</P>
<DT><B>On-the-fly grade II translation</B><DD><P>This would also allow faster
reading of text.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>First, however, we plan to restructure BRLTTY, separating the
low-level Braille display handling from the high-level,
device-independent part; this would allow BRLTTY to coexist with other
programs which access the Braille display, e.g. any future X access
software.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Known Bugs</A></H2>

<P>This software has been tested on
<UL>
<LI> a variety of PCs: both laptops and desktops; processors from
386SX20 to Pentium with a huge range of memory sizes; Linux
distributions including Debian and Slackware; a number of Linux
kernels, including both 1.2.13 and 2.0.0.</LI>
<LI> a DEC Alpha: only tested once, under RedHat Alpha Linux on a
noname board kindly lent to the Cambridge University Computer
Laboratory by DEC in Reading, England.</LI>
</UL>

It has proved stable so far, but if it isn't on your system, or if you
find a bug not mentioned here, please let us know so that we can try
to sort out the problem.</P>
<P>At the time of writing (26 July 1996), the following problems are
known:
<DL>
<DT><B>Cursor routing performance</B><DD><P>Routing is implemented by a looping
sub-process which runs at lowered priority to avoid using too much cpu
time.  Different system loads require different settings of the
parameters here.  The defaults work excellently in a standard Unix
editor on a fairly lightly loaded system, but very badly in other
applications, e.g. some applications working under DOSEmu (the MS-DOS
emulator for Linux).</P>
<DT><B>Operation in DOSEmu</B><DD><P>As well as the cursor routing problems
outlined above, keystroke simulation of any kind does not work
correctly in DOSEmu's raw keyboard mode.  This is because keystroke
simulation must be done differently in this case, possibly by using
scan codes.  This affects the cursor routing and cut &amp; paste
functions.</P>
<DT><B>Pasting non-ASCII characters</B><DD><P>Unfortunately, due to the way the
Linux kernel handles some operations, the character number stored in
video memory for an accent mark etc. may not correspond to the
character value in the keyboard buffer for the same symbol---they are
represented in different character sets.  As a result, pasting of
non-ASCII characters may give strange results.  BRLTTY should probably
do some internal character set translation---this needs further
investigation.</P>
