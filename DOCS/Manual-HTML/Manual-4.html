<P>BRLTTY represents the work of a team, which includes
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="mailto:nico@cam.org">Nicolas Pitre &lt;nico@cam.org&gt;</A> (current maintainer);</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="mailto:s.doyon@videotron.ca">St&eacute;phane Doyon &lt;s.doyon@videotron.ca&gt;</A>
(active developer);</LI>

<A HREF="mailto:nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk">Nikhil Nair &lt;nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk&gt;</A>
(original author, no longer active);</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="mailto:jrbowden@bcs.org.uk">James Bowden &lt;jrbowden@bcs.org.uk&gt;</A>
(now acting in an advisory
capacity).</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Comments, suggestions, criticisms and contributions are welcome.  We will
try to respond promptly to all (sensible) mail, but give no guarantee.  In
general, we suggest you send email messages to both active developers.</P>
<P>If you have a query about a particular display type supported by
BRLTTY, you may want to contact the author of that particular driver.
See the <CODE>README</CODE> file in the relevant subdirectory for contact
details.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 BRLTTY on installation/rescue rootdisks</A></H2>

<P>From version 1.0.1, BRLTTY can run as a stand-alone executable,
without any configuration files.  In this case the compiled-in
defaults will be used.  If the directory <CODE>/etc/brltty</CODE> (used to
store the configuration file, the online help file and the table
files) is not present, BRLTTY looks in <CODE>/etc</CODE> for the help file
<CODE>brlttydev.hlp</CODE> and the configuration file <CODE>brlttyconf.dat</CODE>.
Even if these are not present, BRLTTY will still work!</P>
<P>If, for some reason, you ever create the <CODE>/etc/brltty</CODE> directory by hand,
it is important to set the permissions so that only root can create files
in that directory.</P>
<P>Note: The <CODE>/dev/vcsa0</CODE> device is also required. It should already be
present unless your Linux distribution is quite old. You can create it with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mknod /dev/vcsa0 c 7 128
chown root.tty /dev/vcsa0
chmod 660 /dev/vcsa0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>When constructing floppy rootdisks for installation or rescue
purposes, space is often of the essence.  This new resiliance allows
BRLTTY to be installed as a single executable on such disks, reducing
the space requirement.</P>
<P>Note: The script <CODE>install-brltty</CODE> assumes a complete installation
of BRLTTY is to be copied.</P>
<P>One problem often encountered when trying to use BRLTTY in an uncertain
environment like a bootdisk or an incomplete system is that BRLTTY might not
find the shared libraries it requires. Bootdisks often use smaller but outdated
versions of the libraries which may not work. The solution is to compile
BRLTTY with the <CODE>-static</CODE> flag (see Makefile). This removes any dependency
on shared libraries, but unfortunately produces a larger executable.</P>
<P>The executable is stripped during the <CODE>make install</CODE>. If you take the
executable straight from the compilation directory, don't forget to
<CODE>strip</CODE> it.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Future Enhancements</A></H2>

<P>Apart from fixing bugs and supporting more types of Braille
display, we hope, time permitting, to work on some or all of the
following:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Better attribute handling</B><DD><P>Attribute tracking, mixed text and
attribute mode etc.</P>
<DT><B>Revision of cut &amp; paste</B><DD><P>Linear (as opposed to rectangular)
cut mode.</P>
<DT><B>Revision of beeps</B><DD><P>A greater variety of beeps.</P>
<DT><B>Scroll tracking</B><DD><P>Locking the Braille window on one line as it 
scrolls on the screen.</P>
<DT><B>Elementary speech support</B><DD><P>Mixed Braille and speech for faster
reading of text.</P>
<DT><B>On-the-fly grade II translation</B><DD><P>This would also allow faster
reading of text.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>See the TODO file for a more complete list.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Known Bugs</A></H2>

<P>This software has been tested on
<UL>
<LI> a variety of PCs: both laptops and desktops; processors from
386SX20 to Pentium with a huge range of memory sizes; Linux
distributions including Debian, Slackware, Red Hat and SUSE; a number of Linux
kernels, including 1.2.13, 2.0.0 and 2.0.34.</LI>
<LI> a DEC Alpha: only tested once, under Red Hat Alpha Linux on a
noname board kindly lent to the Cambridge University Computer
Laboratory by DEC in Reading, England.</LI>
</UL>

It has proved stable so far, but if it isn't on your system, or if you
find a bug not mentioned here, please let us know so that we can try
to sort out the problem.</P>
<P>At the time of writing (June 1998), the following problems are
known:
<DL>
<DT><B>Cursor routing performance</B><DD><P>Routing is implemented by a looping
sub-process which runs at lowered priority to avoid using too much cpu
time.  Different system loads require different settings of the
parameters here.  The defaults work excellently in a standard Unix
editor on a fairly lightly loaded system, but very badly in other
situations, e.g. over a slow serial link to a remote host.</P>
<DT><B>Operation in DOSEmu</B><DD><P>Keystroke simulation of any kind does not
work correctly in DOSEmu's raw keyboard mode.  This is because
keystroke simulation must be done differently in this case, possibly
by using scan codes.  This affects the cursor routing and cut &amp;
paste functions.</P>
</DL>
