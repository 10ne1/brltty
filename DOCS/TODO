BRLTTY TODO - 26 July 1996
==========================

(This concerns the main module of BRLTTY.  Individual Braille terminal
drivers may have their own TODO lists.)

Your help is welcome.

Firstly, some restructuring: specification of a standard Braille display
interface library, including standardisation of the use of status cells.

Then (not necessarily in this order):

- Setting marks at convenient places on the screen and jumping to them.

- Defining smaller regions of the screen to be concentrated on.  Cursor
movement outside the current region would be ignored.  This would be
useful if the screen was split into multiple `windows' (e.g. in ytalk).

- Attribute tracking.

- Mixed text + attribute mode, like underlined and/or flashing attributes.

- Keypress simulation within dosemu.

- Revision of cut & paste and implementation of linear mode cut (as opposed
to rectangular mode).

- Revesion of beeps.  Too many events have the same beeps, so we might want
to add new ones. See if we could optimize the use of the console resource.
Implement .au and .wav sounds (through a soundcard).

- Scroll tracking: wouldn't it be great if you could continue reading the
line you're on even when new text is printed and the screen scrolls up?
Like in IRC for instance...

- Support for speech addition: this does not mean a screen reader, it
simply means some added functionality to plain Braille.  It would allow
designating text (with the Braille terminal keys) and sending it to a
speech synthesizer.  Intended to speed up reading of long texts.
This has been implemented for the CombiBraille, but needs generalising.

- On-the-fly grade II translation: translating one line at a time into
grade II Braille would speed up reading.  It may be possible to use some
existing free translation software...

- Support for more Braille displays.
