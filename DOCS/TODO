BRLTTY TODO - March 23, 1999
============================

(This concerns the main module of BRLTTY.  Individual Braille terminal
drivers may have their own TODO lists.)

Your help is welcome.

- Socket interface so external programs (such as Ultrasonix) could make 
  use of all braille terminals supported by BRLTTY.

- Setting marks at convenient places on the screen and jumping to them.

- Defining smaller regions of the screen to be concentrated on.  Cursor
  movement outside the current region would be ignored.  This would be
  useful if the screen was split into multiple `windows' (e.g. in ytalk).

- Attribute tracking.

- Better support for mixed text + attribute mode i.e. underlined and/or 
  flashing attributes.

- Make all braille display drivers dynamically linkable at run time,
  to be able to choose between all different drivers on a distribution
  installation disk for example.

- Keypress simulation within dosemu.  See comments in inskey_lnx.c.

- Linux console charset translation (actually bolted in). See comments
  in scr_vcsa.cc.

- Revision of cut & paste and implementation of linear mode cut (as opposed
  to rectangular mode).

- Revision of beeps.  Too many events have the same beeps, so we might want
  to add new ones. See if we could optimize the use of the console resource.
  Implement .au and .wav sounds (through a soundcard).

- Scroll tracking: wouldn't it be great if you could continue reading the
  line you're on even when new text is printed and the screen scrolls up?
  Like in IRC for instance...

- Better speech support

- On-the-fly grade II translation: translating one line at a time into
  grade II Braille would speed up reading.  It may be possible to use some
  existing free translation software like nfbtrans.

- Support for more Braille displays.

- Port to other Unix platforms.  Since all Linux dependent functions are now
  modularized in separate source files, it would be easy to write other 
  modules to make BRLTTY usable with the screen package or such and then 
  become available for any other Unix platform.  An experimental patch is 
  available in the Patches/ directory.
