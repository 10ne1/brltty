     latest 2.4.0-test* Linux kernels;
   - BRLTTY now doesn't exit on startup when minor i.e. non-fatal
     errors occur;

      notices. (DM)
  - Change the default of the -l option from 4 (LOG_WARNING) to 5 (LOG_NOTICE). (DM)
  - Standardized the way in which drivers identify themselves:
      LOG_NOTICE for configuration information, LOG_INFO for copyright.
      First line no indent, subsequent lines indented 3 spaces. (DM)
  - Added Papenmeier functions: CMD_SAY to status key 5, CMD_MUTE to
      status key 4. (DM)
  - Papenmeier status cells did not say "Info " when in info mode. Fixed. (DM)
  - The default name of the configuration save/restore file is now
      driver-dependent. Renamed from "/etc/brltty/brlttyconf.dat" to
      "/etc/brltty/brltty-XX.dat", where "XX" is the two-letter
      identifier of the braille driver. To preserve current settings
      when upgrading, preserve and rename old file. (DM)
  - Use getopt_long, if the installation has it, to give every option a
      long (--keyword or --keyword=value) name. (DM)

      subdirectory). (DM)

01 January 2000:
  - Released BRLTTY 2.21 (beta)

December 1999:
  - Contribution of a driver for BAUM Vario (emulation mode 2 / HT-Protocol)
    + a Swedish braille table from Per Lejontand <per@acc.umu.se> (with
    assistance from Niklas Edmundsson <nikke@acc.umu.se>). BRLTTY beta
    version 2.20 will be circulated so that this driver can be tested.

October 1999:
  - TSI driver: Workaround for quirks of TSI emulators such as Vario.

June 1999:
  - Completed first stable beta version of MDV driver.

21 June 1999:
  - Released BRLTTY 2.11 (beta)
  - Added support for BrailleLite 40 (NP).
  - Added autodetection of some extra CombiBraille models.  Thanks to
    William Blokland <William_Blokland@tieman.nl>.
  - Added Alva Delphi 80 support.  Thanks to ??? <cstrobel@crosslink.net>.

23 March 1999:
  - BRLTTY 2.1 released.
  - Completed updates to the manual (english version only) for 2.1.
  - missing errno.h for some drivers when compiling on my RedHat (glibc),
    I added the include to misc.h.
  - Work-around for bug in Linux kernel 2.0.35: beeps wouldn't stop...
  - writebrl() and closebrl() now receive a pointer on the brldim structure,
    like inibrl().
  - Removed syslog warning when the default config file doesn't exist.
  - Added EcoBraille support.  Thanks to Oscar Fernandez <ofa@once.es>.
  - Minor update to TSI driver (2.1).
  - Added some bindings for switching settings in config menu. Quickly
    fixed the manual. Regenerated the german manual using latin-1 source
    though not with all suggested options.
  - Some tweaks to the BrailleLite driver (NP)
  - Rework of the config menu so small braille displays can use it.
  - Alva Delphi support added (thanks to Terry Barnaby 
    <terry@beam.demon.co.uk>).
    Now Alva_ABT3 is called Alva.
  - Alva parallel port support added using J. lemmens 
    <jlemmens@inter.nl.net> 's library.

22 December 1998:
  - BrailleLite 18 and Festival support from Nikhil added.
    Also eliminated the need for a fixed menu item length
    and it's now possible to use a display smaller than any menu item i.e.
    the BrailleLite 18.
  - Contribution of Norwegian braille tables and ibm850toiso from 
    Helge Havnegjerde <helge.havnegjerde@c2i.net>

22 July 1998: BRLTTY 2.0 released!
  - Another fix to the cursor routing algorithm
  - Web pages online at http://www.cam.org/~nico/brltty
  - Fixes to compile with egcs and glibc (RH5.1)
  - Fixed Combibraille speech support (broken when BRLTTY moved to 
    ISO-8859-1 base charset while the Combibraille expects an IBM CP437
    charset).
  - Updated manual, FAQ and TODO.
  - Fixes (hopefully) to the cursor routing algorithm in csrjmp_sub.
  - Added syslog support functions, and messages in brltty.c.
  - Added CMD_RESTARTBRL command to reinitialize braille driver when
    the braille display is turned off.
  -  Additions to TSI driver: support for PB65/80, support for all PB models
     at 19200baud, detects when display is turned off and reinitializes itself.
  -  Papenmeier driver update.
  -  EuroBraille driver fixes.
  - Added CMD_CSRJMP_VERT command which routes the cursor to the current line
    but does not try to change the horizontal position. Hopefully will be
    useful in lynx!
  -  Added attribute underlining/blinking functions (experimental).
  -  Incorporated Papenmeier braille terminal driver + German manual.
     Thanks to August Hörandl <hoerandl@elina.htlw1.ac.at> and his team!
  -  Alva driver fixes.


07 April 1998: BRLTTY 1.9.0 pre-release.
  -  Added absolute toggles (ON/OFF) flags to function defines.
  -  Moved braille tables and tools to the BrailleTables directory.
  -  Added Eurobraille terminal series driver.
  -  Now BRLTTY knows which virtual console is active and preserves separate
     information structures for each of them.  This means preserving 
     current window position, tracking and display modes as you switch
     from a virtual console to another. 
  -  Nicolas Pitre now assumes maintenance of BRLTTY since Nikhil Nair
     seems to be unreachable for quite a long time.
  -  Modularized screen drivers, added experimental screen driver to get
     screen image from the "screen" program.  A patch for "screen" is provided
     in the Patches directory.
  -  Made all different methods of handling status cells available
     within the configuration menu.  The default is determined by
     the compiled in braille driver.
  -  Incorporated patch from Joerg Korinek <korinek@ira.uka.de> which lets
     the main BRLTTY process continue while cursor routing is in progress.
     Thanks!
  -  Added some new functions to scr.cc, which add a new `thread' of
     screen reading.  This is used by csrjmp_sub(), to avoid race conditions.
     [The problem was that a forked subprocess shares filedescriptors with
     the parent, and `clone (0, SIGCHLD | COPYVM | COPYFD)' (as documented
     in clone(2)) wouldn't compile.]
  -  CURSOR ROUTING NOW APPEARS TO BE STABLE!!!
  -  BRLTTY placed under CVS revision control - Id headers added to many
     files.
  -  Cursor routing timeout made an idle timeout of 2 seconds: routing
     continues until the cursor is idle for this length of time.
  -  Added CMD_SKPIDLNS.
  -  Speech support modularised.  Added speech.h, as well as SPK_TARGET in
     the Makefile and corresponding directories.
  -  Added very simple speech interface and few speech drivers.
  -  Status cells standardised: two types (Alva/Tieman) or none, switch in
     configuration menu.  Hence another new config file format :-(.
  -  A few bugfixes.
  -  Some job control finetuning in csrjmp() and csrjmp_sub() - now use
     SIGUSR1 to kill child process before another child is forked; child
     blocks this signal for most of the time.
  -  Added support for (optional) Makefiles in driver subdirectories.


17 September 1996: BRLTTY 1.0.2 released.
  -  Incorporated skipping of identical lines.  Adapted to make a line
     containing the cursor different to any other.
  -  Config file format updated, so old config files won't work any more.
  -  Some tidying up of the archive and of the documentation.


13 September 1996: BRLTTY 1.0.1 released.
  -  Speech support added for CombiBraille.
  -  Documentation brought up to date.


3 September 1996: prerelease of BRLTTY 1.0.1.
  -  Screen reading library rewritten from scratch, in C++ (but without
     using any class libraries, so no extra shared libraries are needed).
     In particular, the dependence on the Linux vcsa format is gone: there
     is a new help file format which is far more compact than the old one
     (txt2hlp replaces txt2scrn, brlttydev.hlp replaces brlttyhelp.scr),
     and freeze mode works properly, by using a dynamically allocated
     memory buffer instead of the old /tmp/vcsa.frz hack.
  -  BRLTTY can now survive as a stand-alone executable, with absolutely no
     data files - even if /etc/brltty/ is not found.  This is done by
     compiling in the default text translation table (now selected in the
     Makefile) and the attribute translation table.  The compilation is done
     by using the new filter comptable to generate text.auto.h and
     attrib.auto.h.  A text translation table is now only loaded if the
     -t option is specified.
  -  -q|--quiet now surpresses the start-up message on the Braille display.

  (Documentation still to be updated ...)
     

28 July 1996: BRLTTY 1.0 released.
