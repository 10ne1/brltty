Things that still need to be done

- A typematic (key repetition) feature for routing keys, which would be
useful for commands like CMD_CHRLT and CMD_CHRRT that are bound to routing
keys.

- When entering confmenu, you're often kicked back out because the typematic repression timeout has elapsed during the time the "Configuration menu" message was displayed...

- Support for PowerBraille 65/80, if I can get help from someone that has
such a device. And lots of free time...
