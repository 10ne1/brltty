Things that still need to be done

- Rewrite the beginning of readbrl() for more reliability and less timing
dependancy... readbrl() should not block whenever it receives a byte, it
should return but conserve its state. That feature had been removed for
easier development of the PowerBraille 40 support. However it's been causing
me problems, so I think it's time to put it back!

- A typematic (key repetition) feature for routing keys, which would be
useful for commands like CMD_CHRLT and CMD_CHRRT that are bound to routing
keys.

- Support for PowerBraille 65/80, if I can get help from someone that has
such a device.
