This is the EuroBraille family driver for BRLTTY, version 0.2

COPYING included with BRLTTY for details.

This driver was developped and tested on a very short period of time on 
the ClioBraille 40 from the EuroBraille family.  It should work with 
other models too...  If you can confirm it, please tell me!  Since I 
don't own such a terminal myself, I don't think I can maintain this 
driver acurately.  If you are interrested in maintaining this PLEASE tell 
the BRLTTY team and join us!

There is only a basic key binding in the driver.  You can modify it very 
easily in the brl.c file, near the end.  There is already a "case" 
statement for each possible key.  You just have to insert function codes 
from the ../brl.h file.  If you do so, please update the brlttyhlp.txt 
file too!

Comments, suggestions or patches are welcome!
