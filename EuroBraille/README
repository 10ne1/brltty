COPYING included with BRLTTY for details.

This driver is currently maintained by Yannick Plassiard (me).
It is currently tested on a Clio-noteBraille 40 with Linux Mandrake 6.0.

FIXES/ADDITIONS
===============
1. Added possibility to enter letters directly from the Braille Keyboard
   Note that the table implemented is the CBIFS (Code Braille International
   French Standard). Other tables will be included in other versions.
   If you want me to implement a specific table, just E-mkil me and I'll do
   it for you. :)

2. Changed configuration of the linear and keypad keyboard, the E key  is
   now used to move the braille display to the left and the C key is used
   to display the help screen.

3. Fix the "enter" bug ("\n" is now replaced by "\x0d").

Comments are strongly welcomed, even if they are negatives :) because I
don't know how many people use the EuroBraille version of BRLTTY in the world
so if you use this driver, just e-mail me what are your suggestions for next
versions.
