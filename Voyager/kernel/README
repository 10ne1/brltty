Kernel Driver for the Tieman Voyager Braille Display (USB)

This is the first release of this driver, so it has not been widely
tested yet.

We have tested it with a Voyager 44, but it should also support
the Voyager 70.

This module requires kernel version 2.4.x. We tested 2.4.7 and 2.4.10.

The driver implements a character device. It uses the major number for
USB devices (180) and a currently unassigned minor (as of 2.4.13): we
chose 144. As this minor number is not officially reserved, there is
always a risk that a new USB driver in a later kernel might use it.

Many thanks to the Tieman people: Corand van Strien, Ivar Illing, Daphne
Vogelaar and Ingrid Vogel. They provided us with a Braille display (as
well as programming information) so that we could write this driver. They
replaced the display when it broke and they answered our technical
questions. It is very motivating when companies take an interest in such
projects and are so supportive.

Thanks to Andor Demarteau <ademarte@students.cs.uu.nl> who got this whole
project started and beta-tested all our early buggy attempts.

Installation:

This is a kernel module. It will be compiled for a specific kernel
version, which means you must recompile it if you change your kernel.

USB support must be enabled in your kernel: it must be either compiled
into the kernel or built as modules. You need "Support for USB" plus
either the OHCI or one of the UHCI modules, depending on the type of
controller you have. Recent distributions should have all that already
setup.

You need the kernel sources to compile this module.

The Makefile assumes the kernel sources are in /usr/src/linux. It is also
assumed that these sources are for the same version as the kernel you
are running. If this is not the case then edit the makefile.

Do "make" to compile.

Do "make install" to copy the module to
/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/misc and to run depmod -a.

Insert the module with "modprobe voyager".

Check /var/log/messages for a confirmation or error message.

NB: This module is currently being distributed within BRLTTY for
convenience but might later on be distributed separately and/or be
integrated into the kernel.
