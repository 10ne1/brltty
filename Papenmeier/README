Supported Hardware
==================
This driver is supposed to work with the Papenmeier Screen 2D Terminal
So far, there is only support the buildin table for character translation.

Connection
==========
This driver supports serial communication only.

Before compiling
================
Select the Papenmeier Terminal in the Makefile

  BRL_TARGET = Papenmeier

The Papenmeier Terminal does the translation ASCII to Braille Dots
with an intern table - you don´t have to change the TEXTTRANS entry.

There is also a german translation of the helpfile - create a symbolic link
 ln -s brlttyhelp.ger.txt brlttydev.hlp

Key Bindings and Status Cells
=============================
All the key definitions and Status Cells are listed in the file brlttyhlp.txt.

There is one additional function

UPDATE  update the the display - this is useful if the terminal is switched
        on after the start of the driver. This key can also be used if the 
        display isn´t updated after serial problems.
  
Running the Driver
==================
To compile and run BRLTTY, please refer to the documentation about 
BRLTTY itself. One note though: when BRLTTY starts, it will display 
on the screen some copyright stuff, current configuration (model and 
firmware version setup) and the serial device in use.  That information 
may be useful if nothing happens with the braille terminal.
