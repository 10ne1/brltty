README file for the Papenmeier Driver
=====================================

Version 2.0 (April 2000)

Copyright
=========

This driver is copyrighted under the GNU Public License.  It is free 
software.  See the file '../COPYING' for more details.  Feel free to send 
your comments and to report bugs (if any :)) to us at
august.hoerandl@gmx.at or heimo.schoen@gmx.at

Supported Hardware
==================
This driver is supposed to work with all the Papenmeier Terminals.
The driver is able to autodetect the connected terminal.

Connection
==========
This driver supports serial communication only.

Running the Driver
==================
To compile and run BRLTTY, please refer to the documentation about 
BRLTTY itself. One note though: when BRLTTY starts, it will display 
on the screen some copyright stuff, current configuration (model and 
firmware version setup) and the serial device in use.  That information 
may be useful if nothing happens with the braille terminal.


Key Bindings and Status Cells
=============================
The driver is fully configurable - all key bindings and the status cells
can be fully programmed:

The configuration can be done by
- changing the default configuration in the source file brl-cfg.h
  any changes will be distributed to the online help during compile
- edit the config file /etc/brltty/brltty.pm.conf; don't forget to supply 
  a fitting help file

If you dont want to use the config file you can safely remove the
config file /etc/brltty/brltty.pm.conf and use the compiled in
defaults. On default the driver is compiled with the READ_CONFIG
symbol defined.  Without this symbols the code to read the config file
won't be compiled into the library which gives a library with a much
smaller size.

Help File:
==========
The online help is generated from the compiled in defaults - ist uses
the same syntax of the config file to give the user a short overview of
the status cells and the keymapping.
On default the help command is mapped to the key on the first status cell.

Config File
===========
The configuration file may include the definition for several terminals.
Look at Papenmeier/brltty.pm.conf and the Papenmeier/*.hlp files for 
examples.

Syntax:
#     Comment to the end of line
name = value   you can use 'is' instead of '='; actually you don't have to
 write '=', 'is' and 'and' at all. The following lines are equal:
name = val
name is val
name val

Start a new terminal definition:
identification = NUMBER
the number is the code returned by the terminal on identification 
request; this starts a new terminal defintion - no need to change this infos

Info about the terminal - Name and size of the terminal:
terminal = "String to describe the Terminal"
helpfile = "brltty-pm1.hlp"   # name of the helpfile
displaysize = 40       # number of cells  
statuscells = 0        # number of status cells (horizontal or vertical)
frontkeys = 9          # number of keys on the front of the terminal
haseasybar             # terminal has an easybar (EL types)

Terminal settings:
Statusdisplay settings:
there are different display modes:
 flag: left half: line number, right half: no/all bits set - used with
   vertical status cells
 horiz: two digits on the vertical status-display
 number: display two digits in one cell (status on horiz.display)
example: 
status 4 = horiz cursorcol
status 6 = flag tracking
a list of the possible info to display (see brl.h and/or Papenmeier/hlp.h)
current - current line number
row - cursor position - row
col - cursor position - column
tracking - cursor tracking
dispmode - dispmode (text / attribut)
frozen - screen frozen
visible - cursor visible
size - cursor size
blink - cursor blink
capitalblink - capital letter blink
dots - 6 or 8 dots
sound - sound
skip - skip identical lines
underline - attribute underlining
blinkattr - blinking of attribute underlining

Key definition:
status NUMBER     - key on status cell
front NUMBER      - key on the front side of the terminal
easy DESCR        - easy bar key 
  DESCR may be: left, left2, up, up2, down, down2, right, right2
switch NUMBER     - switches on the left and right side of the 
  display; numbered from 1 (leftmost switch up) to 8 (rightmost switch down)

Modifier key settings:
any key can be defined as a modifier (like the shift or alt key on the 
standard keyboard)

Commandkey settings:
list of definitions:
 command = key 
 command = key and modifier
