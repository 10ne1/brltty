This Driver was written as a project in the
    HTL W1, Abteilung Elektrotechnik, Wien - Österreich
    (Technical High School, Department for electrical engineering,
      Vienna, Austria)

Supported Hardware
==================
This driver is supposed to work with the Papenmeier Screen 2D Terminal.

Connection
==========
This driver supports serial communication only.

Before compiling
================
Select the Papenmeier Terminal in the Makefile

  BRL_TARGET = Papenmeier

There is also a german translation of the help file - move the symbolic link
brlttyhelp.txt from help.us.txt to help.ger.txt with

  ln -sf help.ger.txt brlttyhelp.txt

in the Papenmeier subdirectory.

Key Bindings and Status Cells
=============================
All the key definitions and Status Cells are listed in the file 
brlttyhelp.txt.

Running the Driver
==================
To compile and run BRLTTY, please refer to the documentation about 
BRLTTY itself. One note though: when BRLTTY starts, it will display 
on the screen some copyright stuff, current configuration (model and 
firmware version setup) and the serial device in use.  That information 
may be useful if nothing happens with the braille terminal.

Known Problems
==============
Sometimes during our Test only the first part of the line was updated (this 
could be caused by an old firmware eprom version). If you have similar 
problems: please uncomment the line 
  #define SEND_TWICE_HACK 
near the top of the file brl.c (remove /* and */ ).
